# ghms - Github Milestones

Manages Github milestones across repositories.

# Background
We use waffle.io to manage issues across multiple repositories.  Waffle is a great tool and will automatically create a milestone from one repository in another one if an issue is assigned to that repository.  The issue we were running into is sometimes we needed to close or rename a milestone across all of the repositories.  There was no easy way to do it.  This script will take that list of repositories and can manipulate a milestone across all of them.

We need to add the ability to list the milestones.
